					Hi, I am Kaami, a self taught full stack web developer with experience in HTML, CSS, Node.js, and
					React.js. I have 3+ years of experience in web development and a lot of passion goes into all my
					websites and projects.
					<br />
					<br />
					I have over a dozen projects, many of which can be found here on this website. Feel free to give me
					feedback as I am always open to some constructive criticism. I am most proficient in JS though I do
					have moderate experience in both Python and VB.NET.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you have any questions or if you would like a website made, feel free to contact me via twitter,
					email, or simply the contact page of this website.
